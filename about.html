            <h6 class="synopsis-title">SYNOPSIS</h6>
            <p class="synopsis-blurb">Bluffing is the story of Eric and Marissa, a young married couple who are currently estranged after Eric was 
                caught with a prostitute. When the movie starts, Marissa has agreed to meet Eric in a bar so that he can give 
                his side of the story. But what at first seems like a standard “it’s not what it looks like” speech quickly 
                takes on new meaning as Eric explains his shocking motives for hiring a sex worker.</p> 
                
            <p class="synopsis-blurb">According to Eric, he has been secretly harboring homicidal tendencies since he was a child, culminating in 
                his decision to hire a prostitute in order to, as he puts it, “get it out of his system.” But Marissa isn't 
                having it. Believing he is attempting to cover up his infidelity with an outlandish misdirection, Marissa 
                challenges him to prove he has homicidal tendencies by performing an actual murder.</p>
                
            <p class="synopsis-blurb">In response, Eric, believing that Marissa is merely trying to expose and embarrass him, insists that she help 
                him with the murder, thus preventing her from going to the cops once she sees he’s telling the truth. And 
                from that point on, we watch as Eric and Marissa play a veritable game of chicken, each pushing the other 
                closer and closer to the point of no return.</p>
